The complete file has well over half a million rows. The portion we uploaded is all crimes labelled as \"break and enter\" (in two variants: commercial and residential) and \"theft of\" (in two variants: vehicle and bicycle) in 2018.\n",

    "+ YEAR,MONTH,DAY,HOUR,MINUTE: the reported time of the crime with its 4-digit year, its month as a number 1-12, its day as a number 1-31, its hour in 24-hour format (0-23, where 0 is midnight), and its minute (0-59); 0 or midnight sometimes means \"data is missing\" rather than an actual time\n",
